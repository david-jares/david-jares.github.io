    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains who we are, how we process (i.e. collect, record, organize, structure, store, adapt
        or
        alter, retrieve, consult, use, disclose by transmission, disseminate or otherwise make available, align or
        combine,
        restrict, erase or destruct) personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. We
        are
        <b>FunkyTape</b>(referred in this document as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), a
        developer
        and publisher of games and mobile game applications that are made available via app stores including the Apple
        App
        Store and Google Play Store. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that we collect through our
        games,
        mobile applications and other products (“Games”) (together “Services”). By using our Services, you agree to be
        bound
        by this Privacy Policy and consent to our processing of information as specified therein.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Information we collect from you</b></h2>
    <p>Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Games or interact
        with
        third-party ads in our Games or with our ads in other publisher’s Games. In general, the information we collect
        about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you
        play
        our Games and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us. We may also collect
        information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your
        interests
        and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).</p>
    <p>Besides that, we use third-party platforms for mobile analytics and in-game advertising. When you use our games,
        those platforms collect information about the ways in which you use and interact with our games, such as when
        and
        for how long you play our games, purchases you make, progress or levels you achieve and other gameplay
        activities.
    </p>
    <p>The information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4><strong>Information that you provide voluntarily</strong></h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask
        for
        certain information in order for you to submit enquiries to us, such as:</p>
    <p>-> your name, email address or other details, necessary to process your inquiries;</p>
    <p>-> any information you submit to our support team via email.</p>
    <p>The personal information that you are asked to provide and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will
        try
        to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Information that we collect automatically</strong></h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device
        which
        may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
    <p>-> Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session
        length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game
        preferences,
        the means by which you were referred to our Services)</p>
    <p>-> Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers.</p>
    <p>-> Your device type and the operating system that you use</p>
    <p>-> Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address</p>
    <p><i><span id="addId2">Advertising ID</span></i> means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and
        Google
        Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for
        personalized
        advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you
        can
        opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt
        out of
        these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal
        identifiers,
        which are uniquely associated with your device.</p>
    <p><i>Device identifier / information</i> means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and
        its
        language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a
        device
        for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Information we obtain from third-party sources</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>-> Third-Party Social Network/s. Google Play Games Service, Apple Game Center, Facebook (“Third-Party Social
        Network/s”). You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. Exactly what information
        we
        receive from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it would typically include
        your basic public profile information such as your username, gender, your friends playing the same Game.</p>
    <p>-> Third party service providers. We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. We may
        get
        your personal information for example when you installed our Game and prior to installing you have clicked an
        advertisement for the same Game.</p>
    <p>-> Advertising partners. From time to time, we may also receive personal information about you from other
        third-party
        sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services (such as an advert
        of
        one of our Games in other publisher’s game), we will be provided with information from which ad network and
        advertising campaign the install originated from.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>No special categories of information</strong></h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as personal data revealing
        racial
        or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic
        data,
        biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data
        concerning a
        natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. Kindly be cautious when sharing this information about yourself
        (or
        others) in our forums.</p>
    <h2><b>How we use your information</b></h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect about you/your device to deliver services and our Games to you and to operate
        our
        business. We use it also for improving our services and Games, for enhancing security and for analytics and
        research
        purposes to make sure we provide you with the best experience. In addition, we use your information to promote
        our
        services and Games in our Games and also in other publisher’s apps and to display third-party advertisements to
        you.
        We use your information also for tracking and fraud prevention for advertising purposes and for complying with
        our
        legal obligations.</p>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <h3><strong>Analytics and research</strong></h3>
    <p>Like many apps, we use mobile analytics to record player behavior.</p>
    <p>Particular events in the game are logged and sent to a third-party server for analysis. This lets us understand
        player behavior and helps us improve our games.</p>
    <p>Mobile analytics data is aggregated and is not personally identifiable. Your analytics data is not associated
        with
        your player data in the game (eg. Player ID or save game data).</p>
    <p>We use Unity Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Game Analytics for this service.</p>
    <p>Unity Analytics helps us understand the player behavior and help us improving game experience and optimize our
        game
        design to satisfy better the needs of our users.</p>
    <p>The data collected is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users identities.
        However, the data are stored and processed by Unity. You can learn more about how Unity handles your personal
        data
        here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></p>
    <p>Facebook Analytics helps us understand how people are using our iOS and Android games. Data in Facebook Analytics
        is
        driven by app events and user properties. App Events describe something a user did, while properties describe an
        attribute of the user.</p>
    <p>Facebook Analytics reports help us better understand our customers and their behavior. We added events to our
        games
        to view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting on Facebook and Instagram to
        increase the installs of our mobile games. For example, we can create &#8220;look-alike audiences&#8221; to
        target
        campaigns to new people who are similar to our best customers.</p>
    <p>The data collected is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users&#8217;
        identities.
        However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and
        which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. Check out
        Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>
    <p>We use Game Analytics to collect crash reports and errors from our game to improve game stability. The data
        collected
        is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users. Also the data collected belongs
        to
        Game Analytics. You can learn more about date privacy here: <a
            href="https://gameanalytics.com/privacy">https://gameanalytics.com/privacy</a></p>
    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>We use advertising to fund our Services and to make our games available for free. We offer our games for free or
        at
        low cost and in order to do that we need to share information we collect from you with our third-party
        advertising
        partners. The information collected helps us to improve our games and, at the same time, keep our games free for
        a
        wide player base.</p>
    <p>To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks)
        to
        enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control
        and
        limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in
        our
        games (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.</p>
    <p>Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes including:</p>
    <p>-> limit the number of times you see the same ad;</p>
    <p>-> ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;</p>
    <p>-> serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID engagement with other
        brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy
        advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our games. The ad
        network or
        ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and us. In order for an ad network to charge
        the
        company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps
        are
        tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;</p>
    <p>-> keep track what games you have used to market you similar kind of games. IP-address is typically used by
        advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and
        sometimes
        at city level).</p>
    <p>For our EAA-based users we made sure that our advertising partners are fully compliant with the GDPR law. Before
        sharing any information with our advertising partners for the purposes of personalized advertising, we always
        ask
        for your consent, given when you press accept at relevant button at loading of the game. We allow our
        advertising
        partners to show personalized ads to you only if you have pressed ACCEPT in relevant pop-up window and so
        consented
        to the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of personalized advertising. Our advertising
        partners
        use different technologies for the purposes of personalized advertising that process your personal information
        in
        different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you ACCEPT to show you personalized ads
        at
        loading of the game. Find bellow the list of our advertising partners:</p>
