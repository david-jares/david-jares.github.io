OVERVIEW
This Privacy Policy explains who we are, how we process (i.e. collect, record, organize, structure, store, adapt or alter, retrieve, consult, use, disclose by transmission, disseminate or otherwise make available, align or combine, restrict, erase or destruct) personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. We are FunkyTape (referred in this document as “we,” “us” or “our”), a developer and publisher of games and mobile game applications that are made available via app stores including the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that we collect through our games, mobile applications and other products (“Games”) (together “Services”). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and consent to our processing of information as specified therein.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Games or interact with third-party ads in our Games or with our ads in other publisher’s Games. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our Games and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).

Besides that, we use third-party platforms for mobile analytics and in-game advertising. When you use our games, those platforms collect information about the ways in which you use and interact with our games, such as when and for how long you play our games, purchases you make, progress or levels you achieve and other gameplay activities.

The information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:

Information that you provide voluntarily
Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask for certain information in order for you to submit enquiries to us, such as:

-> your name, email address or other details, necessary to process your inquiries;

-> any information you submit to our support team via email.

The personal information that you are asked to provide and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

Information that we collect automatically
When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:

-> Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game preferences, the means by which you were referred to our Services)

-> Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers.

-> Your device type and the operating system that you use

-> Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address

Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.

Device identifier / information means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.

Information we obtain from third-party sources
-> Third-Party Social Network/s. Google Play Games Service, Apple Game Center, Facebook (“Third-Party Social Network/s”). You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. Exactly what information we receive from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it would typically include your basic public profile information such as your username, gender, your friends playing the same Game.

-> Third party service providers. We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. We may get your personal information for example when you installed our Game and prior to installing you have clicked an advertisement for the same Game.

-> Advertising partners. From time to time, we may also receive personal information about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services (such as an advert of one of our Games in other publisher’s game), we will be provided with information from which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from.

No special categories of information
We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. Kindly be cautious when sharing this information about yourself (or others) in our forums.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use the information we collect about you/your device to deliver services and our Games to you and to operate our business. We use it also for improving our services and Games, for enhancing security and for analytics and research purposes to make sure we provide you with the best experience. In addition, we use your information to promote our services and Games in our Games and also in other publisher’s apps and to display third-party advertisements to you. We use your information also for tracking and fraud prevention for advertising purposes and for complying with our legal obligations.

We use your information for the following purposes:

Analytics and research
Like many apps, we use mobile analytics to record player behavior.

Particular events in the game are logged and sent to a third-party server for analysis. This lets us understand player behavior and helps us improve our games.

Mobile analytics data is aggregated and is not personally identifiable. Your analytics data is not associated with your player data in the game (eg. Player ID or save game data).

We use Unity Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Game Analytics for this service.

Unity Analytics helps us understand the player behavior and help us improving game experience and optimize our game design to satisfy better the needs of our users.

The data collected is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Unity. You can learn more about how Unity handles your personal data here: https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy

Facebook Analytics helps us understand how people are using our iOS and Android games. Data in Facebook Analytics is driven by app events and user properties. App Events describe something a user did, while properties describe an attribute of the user.

Facebook Analytics reports help us better understand our customers and their behavior. We added events to our games to view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting on Facebook and Instagram to increase the installs of our mobile games. For example, we can create “look-alike audiences” to target campaigns to new people who are similar to our best customers.

The data collected is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users’ identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. Check out Facebook’s privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.

We use Game Analytics to collect crash reports and errors from our game to improve game stability. The data collected is anonymous to us and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users. Also the data collected belongs to Game Analytics. You can learn more about date privacy here: https://gameanalytics.com/privacy

Advertising
We use advertising to fund our Services and to make our games available for free. We offer our games for free or at low cost and in order to do that we need to share information we collect from you with our third-party advertising partners.  The information collected helps us to improve our games and, at the same time,  keep our games free for a wide player base.

To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in our games (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.

Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes including:

-> limit the number of times you see the same ad;

-> ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;

-> serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and us. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;

-> keep track what games you have used to market you similar kind of games. IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level).

For our EAA-based users we made sure that our advertising partners are fully compliant with the GDPR law. Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for the purposes of personalized advertising, we always ask for your consent, given when you press accept at relevant button at loading of the game. We allow our advertising partners to show personalized ads to you only if you have pressed ACCEPT in relevant pop-up window and so consented to the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of personalized advertising. Our advertising partners use different technologies for the purposes of personalized advertising that process your personal information in different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you ACCEPT to show you personalized ads at loading of the game.
